# Project_1_Digital-Clock_Tkinter

# This Project uses TKINTER Library
### This is a library used for standard GUI application

###  *Import command* : import tkinter

## Digital Clock Using Tkinter :(All about the library)

## 1) Root Command of Tkinter :
###     -> root = tkinter.tk()
###     -This creates a window with a titlebar and default decorations provided by windows provider.
###     -Only one can be created and should be included before any other.

## 2) Label Command of Tkinter :
###     ->  w = tkinter.label(root, text = "Hello")
###       -This displays the text in the window that the user can veiw but not interact.

###     ->  logo = tk.Photoimage(file = ".........../the path of the image")
###       v = tk.label(root, image = logo)
###       -Used to Display the image

###      ->  tk.label(root, text = "Hello" , fg = "red", font = "times")
###        -Used to include the desired font and color to the text.

## 3) Pack Command of Tkinter:
###     ->  w.pack()
###       -where w is the variable 
###       - this command fix the label command text and image to the windows size.

###     ->  w.pack(side = "left")
###       - Used to allign the contents to the left.

## 4) Exit Loop of Tkinter 
###     ->  root.mainloop()
###       - Used to exit the function, a must include one at the end of the program.



## Things I learned will programming:
###  1)Indentation matters a lot in Python Programming
###  2)While defining a function using def command make sure not to leave a space before colon.
###       def function():    - is the right way!
